# Keras Classification 

## Keras implementation on a unknown dataset

Classification is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a categorical label. A few useful examples of classification include predicting whether a customer will churn or not, classifying emails into spam or not, or whether a bank loan will default or not.

based on the various learning algorithms with different scenario . we are going to demonstrate the keras classification.

## In Summary
* Using keras classifier on new data set 
* Check accuracy will improved with the large networks
* Check the accuracy will be improved after dropout 
* Check accuracy after delay learning rate by using SGD optimizer

## Result

| Learning algo        | accuracy |
| ------------ |---------------|
| Keras classifier     | 65%      |
| After Large networks | 81%      |
| After Drop Out       | 85%      |
| After Delay Learning | 82%      |
